Impressive hardware, the heptics, the autobrightness & otherwise highly ignored things in Android are way too perfectly executed in iPhone and it DOES make a big difference in user experience!!2.

Yes that much high charging will effect health of battery but 20 W is way way too less, if Apple is such a legendary company they should have created a battery that can withstand decently fast charging while instead they just use slow charging to keep their battery\'s health.2. Overy exhagerated software experience, reality is that Android is more user friendly with better gesture & commonsense options & settings & steps to do simple things. iOS looks pretty yes but UX engineers at Apple have really done a crappy job.. there\'s still no notification grouping in correct manner (its executed poorly), no proper homescreen customisation & just so so so many \'commonsense\' things are missing from iOS I can rant all day about it. Everything you can do in Android with a single click or swipe takes 2 swipes and then a click to do in iOS its SOOOOO ANNOYING. Like you want to clear a notification? Swipe and then click on clear. You want to open a notification? Swipe FIRST and then click open.. like wth????????3. DON\'T believe Apple fanboys who scream about speed, Android phones are equally snappy in performance today. There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.4. FaceID is nice but an in-fingerprint reader seems the best ID to me atleast, that\'s missing.5. Ridiculously expensive accessories6. Battery life is above good but not great.In the end I would say iPhone, overall, does provide a better experience (mostly cuz of hardware only) but it\'s expensive.

iPhone is the standard against which all smartphones are compared,"I purchased this phone for my wife. Last year I purchased iPhone X for my son who is currently in the UK. I own an iPad and iMac 27\'. I am not going to buy an iPhone for myself - at least not yet. One of the main things that I don\'t like about Android phones is the crap (bloatware) that each maker puts in. Moto and Google Pixel come with pure stock Android. So those can be left out. So I wanted a good phone for my wife so that she could FaceTime with my son in the UK anytime.What is there to say? So many have written about it. Since everyone writes all the positives, I will write some negatives. While there aren\'t too many, no product can be perfect:1. Brings in all the junk from the old phone. If one is switching from Android to iPhone, the \'Move to iOS\' app on Android can help. However be sure to clean up your Android phone first else all junk (especially \'Good Morning\', \'Good day\' picture crap from WhatsApp photos). Be sure to clean the SMS inbox also, especially all those blocked and spam messages which may be hidden from the main view and we never know that exist.2. WhatsApp cannot be synced. Yes, there are 3rd party apps but they are full of ad-crap and I can\'t trust them for security.3. Difficulty in validating iMessage and FaceTime. I could not activate iMessage and FaceTime with my mobile number. I simply could not figure this out. This is the case with my Vodaphone SIM/Number in India. Only when I added my email to my Apple ID, the two apps started working. Even now, the mobile number is not verified.4. I wish Apple provides dual SIM. Now dual SIM is almost a necessity. But as my wife does not use two SIMs, for her, it is fine.5. Apple is providing USB-C to lightning cable. They should supply USB-A to lightning cable instead. 99% of the chargers have a USB-A output. I had to purchase a USB-A to USB-C mini adapter (₹180) for this, or someone may have to buy a cable of the type (good cables from Apple, Belkin, Anker cost ₹1100 and above). By far, this is my biggest grouse.6. This is not the latest iPhone. The iPhone 13 was ₹73,000 and did not seem VFM. Even at ₹56,000 (₹55,900 to be exact), the iPhone12 may not be money best spent. This is one reason, why I haven\'t purchased an iPhone for myself all this while (I can afford to buy the latest one every year).",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Confused? Read on! One stop review for your flagship purchase.,"I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I’ve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive. If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021),  apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra.  If you read a few reviews you’ll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues  and 9pro cameras didn’t live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand5. The haptics are spot onWhat’s Missing: (Minor misses though)1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you’ll get used to it.2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensorWait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:It took a while for 12’s prices to fall.  If you’re willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.64GB or 128GB:The difference is around ₹6000.  64GB if you don’t play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128😊Battery:I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to  it’s competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.Android Flagship Option:The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.Hope this review helped :)Update:13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That’s it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12’s launch price(86k).  If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still  do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k).  However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022.",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Not Really worth the money,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items.  But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.PROS : Camera & PerfomanceCONS : Battery and Cost",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

The real problem started while using it,The Phone started to overheat for minimal usages, I\'d call for 5 to 10 minutes hands would be burning with phone heat, 15 minutes of social media again hands would be burning hot, I didn\'t get any temperature warning but heat was hot enuf for me to keep it aside for a long period of time, Due to overheat the battery used to die fast and I would hv required to charge it thrice a day. I roamed around the Apple authorized service centres and so many calls to Amazon for a replacement but nobody seems to give me any solution, then I thought I\'ll just use it, but again it started getting worse and I called Apple and they said to give my phone to service centre for 7 to 10 days so they can diagnosis be done and find out issue while I survive 7 to 10 days without a phone haha, then I couldn\'t take it anymore as I understood if I continue using this phone I wouldn\'t get 4 weeks yet alone 4 years and pleaded to Amazon coz I am a prime member ever since prime was out and I have ordered tons and tons of products in Amazon and never faced this issue.But the hard earned money going like this was hurting so I submitted whatever documents Amazon asked me to get from Apple and finally they gave me return for this product.The item has been returned and get to reach their warehouse which then oly I will get my refund initiated which is gonna take another 15 to 20 days, but I\'m fine since I can wait and not lose my hard earned money. For now I hv a 7 year old phone as backup which is working ok ok but I can manage to write atleast this review.So whoever face this issue, and wants a replacement or return please try your best with whatever Amazon asks from you n they will provide a solution.I still need to buy an Apple phone next coz I bought the 2k adapter and it\'s return period got over haha.Anyways the Phone was amazing to use,So performance wise 5/5Camera was just amazing 5/5Battery tho 1 or 2/5Over heating so -2/5 or 0/5Overall a bad experience but still excited to get apple product.Btw Apple service centres help very well and listen to ur problems and provide solutions properly and handles it well.So if you are getting a iPhone I hope u guys don\'t face any situation like mine.Thank you n have  a great day :)",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

Great product,"This is not the first iPhone, so nothing more to review on iOS or iPhone, but something specific to this phone/ experience is jotted below.1. I upgraded from iPhone SE (1st gen) to this one. The migration was super smooth. Just power on and keep besides the old phone, in almost 30mins you are done. Everything including apps and app settings are migrated.2. Camera is really great.3. I wanted a small set, I guess iPhone 12 mini would have been an ideal choice.

Beast🤩🤩🤩🤩,"Hello there,I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-MemoryBuild qualityCameraProcessorDisplayExcept battery there’s rumour going on that iPhone 12 battery is bad or worst, so i am here to clarify all your doubts,iPhone battery will last easily a day but not more than that and here’s some condition that you should aware about1. If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you’re on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.Here’s some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know “How to save battery on iPhone 12” this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don’t have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.Got original product Btw!!!!!",64,RED,YES,5,Negative
Switched from android to apple first time and it’s not that difficult to understand.,"its amazing so far, if you’re looking for great battery backup- playing games whole day, it’s not worth it.. battery drains fast but if you’re a user who just wants to get through the day and use it for work only… battery would be okay at the end of day.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

Just Wow....,"I have been using iPhone SE 2020 since last year which has been a great experience for me. Now that I bought IPhone 12 it is also a great phone with so many features. But the best thing I have experienced is the camera quality. It is way much better than any other phone at this rate. I bought this phone in Great Indian Sale and bought only for 47 K which is also been a benefit for me. It\'s build quality is good and it is light weighted, lighter than Iphone SE 2020. The processor is fast but the battery back up is not up to the mark. It goes from 100 to 20 in a day use and I am not using it much so the battery is not that good. I also have to buy the 20w charger and it is really charging fast. When you are holding the phone it will make you feel premium. The phone hasn\'t lag since one month use. It will regularly get updates which is great. Other than battery backup there is nothing you will regret about the phone. Overall an iphone is and iphone. At least you will look rich.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive
In the era of 14 this is still beast,"Using for few months, no heating issue, but night camera is worst.",64,RED,YES,4,Negative
This is a very good phone.  The seller is reliable.,"iPhone 12 is a good product. If you are not obsessed with the ‘latest and the best’ type of phone, go for any apple phone on the list. I chose 12 because it is 5 G compliant.  If you are a price watcher, this is perhaps the best time to buy this one. I bought my phone earlier this month, and the price has dropped by  one thousand rupees since then! But I am happy with the phone. Apple phones are expensive, but once you use an iPhone, you may not wish to use any other phone. I have been using a 5S for ten years. Only recently I changed the battery. It still looks good and works fine. You may take a couple of days to get used to the new device. 128 prices have dropped, 64 prices have remained almost the same since early October. This seller is good. Initially I was a bit unsure about buying it online, but if you live in a small city even buying from an apple store is almost like online buying. Go for it. Too early to comment on battery life. For  best results, keep your iPhone phone on low battery mode, except while charging.",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Long Term Review: Excellent All Rounder Device,"This is going to be a long review, sit back, relax and have a read.I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.And boy was I surprised . Let’s take up the review in sections.1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it’s only for social media and you are not printing really big.3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it’s average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended.",64,RED,YES,4.5,Positive
Good for normal use,Build quality and performance is premium.iOS has its pros n cons. Recent iOS versions are less restrictive.Camera is consistent.Battery life is above average. It gets warm sometimes. Charging speed is fine. I wont recommend it for gaming.iPhones are on the pricier side but I am expecting long term use with the same snappier feel and less bugs.,64,RED,YES,5,Positive
Worthy Product,"Worth spending money on this product.No regrets. From using apps ,to playing games and superior camera quality this product contains all features essential for me.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive
Phone is great but iOS sucks,"First of all, I don\'t know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn\'t feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.Now let\'s talk about the cell phone itself.It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn\'t only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-1. Notifications- You can\'t reply through notifications.- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can\'t just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it\'s really painful to scroll through all the notifications.2. App library- It has something called app library, they thought it\'d be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.3. whatsapp- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.- Sometimes when you click on someone\'s profile then instead of opening the user\'s profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp\'s issue not iOS)- You can\'t directly send any media as a document (preserving it\'s quality). There are steps to do that too.The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone\'s hardware is bad, it\'s actually quite opposite of bad, it\'s fast and amazing.I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing.",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Absolutely loved the phone but price could have been bit cheaper,"I phone i must say having great optimization of software with hardware, more quality apps are available when compared to google, receiving a file is the only major pain i felt till now,Battery backup is really good 2800 mAh in apple is almost like 5000mAh in android am not kidding, i have rog phone 3 it is 6000 mAh but at the end of the day the i phone has almost same % left, may be it\'s due to the less hz display.Despite of having 60Hz display it feels goodAnd what can i say the speakers are loud and clear compared with rog 3.45k should have been the right price for 64gb model but for 53k it\'s not a bad deal either, if you ask me spending 50k for an android is not worth since i phone has all hardware and software superiority.No charger is a big let down by apple. And finally 64gb is good enough if you ask me as most of those having wifi connection can easily upgrade to i cloud paying just 75rs/Month and for the average 3 years of use the price will be still 2700rs in three year. For the 128gb i had to pay 8000rs more so still i am saving around 5300rs if i chose to use i cloud from the starting day.No Finger print sensor , but it\'s ok the face id does it right but yes the finger print should be good. And for the notch it\'s ok. I phone 12 and 13 has virtually no difference so y to waste 20k more money buying the 13 just for the bit improvement of camera and brightness, hope you like my review 🙂",64,RED,YES,4.5,Positive

Best Iphone,"Phones been amazingI have used iphone 4s , 5 , 6s and xr but I liked it.Long battery life, not quite as good as iPhone 13 but Close. Plus I didn’t like the weight and thickness of iPhone 13  just to get maybe 45-60 minutes more time at the most. I don’t see any difference in speed between Bionic14 and Bionic 15 what so ever. And to much hype for the 120 h refresh rate, no noticeable difference at all. Also I actually think iPhone 12 pictures look better than iPhone 13 because by supposedly having slight bit more detail they over saturate the black in them. Love the thin weightless feel in iPhone 12 and have had zero issues. I’m keeping this phone till the wheels fall off. Great value.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

How to decide between iPhone 11 and 12,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ₹ 84900. After credit card discount(₹6000), old phone exchange(₹3450) and reward points money(₹4530) inclusion, I bought it for ₹70920. There’s also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn’t let go of blue1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it’d cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn’t seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.2: DISPLAY: I’ve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.How to choose between 64/128gb:If you’re not really tight on budget, I’d suggest to go for 128gb variant. I’ve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage  occupied about 60gb. So it’d make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.CONS:1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price2. If you’re an android user, migration would be little time consumingUpdate: I’ve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

An overpriced Average product,"I wanted to explore how good is Apple compared to Android. I must say the only good thing about this is consistency in both cameras and various different lightings. However on a number of occasions it does make you look darker than what ever you are. I find more cons tha pros so here is a list1. Network connectivity and wifi is not upto the mark. My OnePlus 9 pro will have better coverage with same wifi and network.2. At this exorbitant price, it\'s painful to see 60hz screen. You would find the scrolling painfully slow.3. Every accessory is expensive and the quality of these accesories is not something out of the world.4. The charging speed is really slow. Some claim fast chargers ruin the battery. But i had OnePlus phones easily lasting 3 plus of battery with fast charge. Have seen couple of iPhones draining battery within 2 years. My friends have iPhone 11 which i am referring to.5. Lack of customisation and the same boring look of the icons and you need to search numerous things to share anything.6. Face ID gets annoying at times. You need to also have other ways like fingerprint apart from passcode to unlock when u want to answer video calls.7. The nasty notch. I dont know if apple needs another decade to remove this. The new series pill shape is not either the best looking.8. Lock into the ecosystem and lack of flexibility.",64,RED,YES,5,Negative
Looks are Premium rest everything is Mediocre,The look of the phone is definitely great.The green one looks fantastic but rest everything is mediocre.The battery backup is really bad.The selfie camera is not upto the mark and couldn’t justify its price point.The only good thing about this phone is it will make you feel premium. The rear camera takes great photos. The processor is fast.Overall android at this price point makes a huge sense.,64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Outstanding & Best selling iPhone,"The iPhone 12 sports a gorgeous design, full 5G support, great cameras and strong performance. However, the limited base storage is a drawback even at its new reduced price.👍Beyond adding 5G, Apple has equipped the iPhone 12 family with its powerful new A14 Bionic processor, a Super Retina XDR display, a more durable Ceramic Shield front cover, and a MagSafe feature for more reliable wireless charging, and support for attachable accessories.Pros+Attractive new design with MagSafe👍+Comprehensive 5G coverage👍+Impressive dual cameras👍+Fastest performance in this price range👍+Solid battery life👍Cons-Lacks 120Hz display (minor)-No optical zoomApart of this it’s design can win ur heart at first look, Ratina X display is awesome & if you r using iPhone 11 or later then there is significant improvement in terms of sound, display & weight, it is too skinnyFor me this is most sexiest phone ever 👍",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Also the stock keyboard is very small so I use swift keyboard  so if you are planning  for mini  please  reconsider  your  thoughtsPros: Camera, Video, Audio, build quality, DisplayCons: Small keyboard, Going to previous screen is not easy like android, Case cover is must because  smudge comes easy in backside, Little  bit feeling hotter than Android.Update: After using it for a week, the battery is very very bad in ios 16, an android user will not feel good.But I use it on table, so it\'s not a problem for me. If I decide to use it for outdoor video recording, I\'ll definetly buy a powerbank, otherwise this will be a disaster.",64,RED,YES,4,Negative

It came safely and works well. Always record an unboxing video and ask the derivery person to wait if possible (I didn’t make him wait in my case, just recorded unboxing). I checked everything and the serial no. on the apple site. I’ gonna use it in my mbbs journey that is about to start soon and I’m so glad.

Beast,"This is not an exaggerated review. I have used Xperia, Pixel, and iPhone most of the time. So far I have used Xperia Z/X/Z3 compact, Pixel 2/3/4A, iPhone 8/XR/11 and now using this iPhone 12.In my opinion, this is the best phone I have ever used and it is one of the best smartphones available in the market, even in 2022.Pros: Great display, buttery smooth performance, excellent RAM management, iCloud services, camera, and of course battery life. Initially, I was worried because of the battery life. Because on paper it is just a 2815 mAh battery. But the way the A14 chip manages the performance and battery is spectacular.Cons: No telephone lens. Though I hardly require it (but this is the only cons I think it has).",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

I miss my OnePlus 6,"Android v/s iOSPro Apple1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.And with a future update, facebook won\'t be able to track what you\'re doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud. 2. BatteryThe battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can\'t touch this. If you bring this up with them, they\'ll distract you by saying it has fast charging.3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.4. Build Quality - SOLID.5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be \'raam bharose\', but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won\'t work. Half baked implementation.Pro Android / Anti - iOS1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year\'s model can make it better.4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don\'t think that these don\'t stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.I\'ll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they\'re way too deep in ios ecosystem now.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

"READ before BUY ! ""Iphone 12! Worth buying or not?""","From owner POV, It\'s completely different experience for me as I\'ve come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I\'m lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.As per the limitations :1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn\'t feel like one)2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name\'s not Sanjib \'Ambani\' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)Advantages:1. It\'s a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it\'s best in the market.2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)3. Display (Can\'t find much difference if you\'re a Samsung flagship user.)4. The design and in-hand feel.5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it\'s premium.Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.But iPhone 12 in 2020?  its a technological wonder. It\'s very slim, premium and beautiful.If you\'re comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience.",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Great purchase!,"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn\'t buy them somehow. I wasn\'t and I\'m not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn\'t eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I\'m quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.When it comes to iPhone 12, it\'s a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I\'m gonna used to of it.I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.INR 3000₹ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000₹ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000₹. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn\'t included and it coasted 1900₹ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.Overall it\'s a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive
For first time iPhone Users,"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don\'t drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there\'s no light, so thats that. But it can\'t identify you with the mask, you\'re left to the PIN when you\'re in the outside.The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it\'ll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

A better blackberry,IPhone is about to meet the fate of blackberry. A privacy based phone alone can’t survive in this era of fast changing world. We have seen it with blackberry. IOS UI feels like you are in Stone Age. But you will be happy with unwanted ads not popping up in your screen or on your screensaver. But the time will come when you will see ads soon in your iPhone too coz there’s huge money involved. Lots of customisation is required in UI to smoothen the functional use. There isn’t any drastic changes since. If you are fed up with android ads and privacy issues go for iPhone. But it wouldn’t be easy as you would feel like using a Samsung S1. 10years old,64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Best selling phone in the world!!!,"No wonder Apple makes some of the best phones in the world. Iphone 12 deservedly is the highest selling phone.I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what\'s to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there\'s no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it\'s as advertised.Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it\'s prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase.",64,RED,YES,4.5,Positive

Kidney as a Service (KaaS),"Everything is good so far. But, it needs to be taken care with the extra attention.You may buy this phone, if below points are considerable for you -• Back Camera - Crystal clear with 4K @60 FPS (I would say, just X-ray technology is missing in it and I trust Apple will even add it in it’s upcoming devices.)• Front Camera - Excellent/Very bad (Very bad: because, few Papa ki Pari/Paraa kind of peoples would certainly hate this camera as this captures everything on your face. So, filters are highly unexpected using the main camera. Though, filter apps can be used.)• Battery - Excellent/Bad (Bad: For those who are expecting to buy this device for hardcore gaming purpose as it drains so fast.)• Performance - Excellent (No comments)",64,RED,YES,5,Negative

A good device. But a lot of unnecessary hassles involved to get the most basic things done.,"Don not buy an iPhone if you need things done smoothly. Most day to day tasks will be smooth.

First of all i was a lil sceptical about buying an expensive phone online. But after so much of research and asking friends I have ordered the phone. And now after unboxing and using it for 3-4 days, I can surely rely on online purchase. Amazon delivered a good genuine product. I\'ve also bought it during a sale on Amazon so got a good deal. Overall a very very good experience. Highly recommend.",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Apple should wait for at least 2 years before launching a new iPhone.,"Well they are a multinational conglomerate and I have simply purchased a product of theirs, so I shouldn’t be commenting on their product launching strategy. However keeping this aside, I would try to genuinely help those looking for reviews before buying, in a few simple steps.1. Go for it if you are going for an upgrade after  3-4 years, as it will give you some flawless experience again.2. Battery life is not upto the mark, I feel XR that I used before this had a good battery, maybe I am wrong.3. Face ID has got no significant improvement at all, again I think XR had a better face detection.4. Camera I could sense something has been done.5. Coming to interface and product performance, it is flawless, smooth, faster.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive
Received with stain and finger prints,"As soon i opened the i have noticed finger prints on apple logo, i was careful enough to not touch the phone while lifting the box top, this was my 12 Th. apple product hence I’m well aware of the brand packaging and unboxing experience.on further observation i have noticed paint or glue stain on the outer bezel as well as scratch marks on the charging port which i didn’t even use.created replacement and it seems to be taking another 2 weeks. btw the first one i received in 4 days.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive
Perfect if this is what you want,"What I Liked.1) Weight Balancing2) Battery Optimisation3) Software update upon unboxing4) Camera and Security featuresWhat I didn\'t like1) Limitations of common Charger. I have to use different charging cables for my iPhone, while my iPad Pro, Samsung Buds etc share a USB C cable.2) Some advertised features require the support of additional devices of Apple Eco System. For example, Apple said with iOS 15.3 face ID will work even with Masks On. But I just learned that this feature works only if you have an iWatch also.3) Not a gamer, but still for this price point at least a 90Hz refresh was desirable.4) Front Camera, sometimes have not of noise (nitpicking)At the end of the day, I am happy with my purchase. But I strongly recommend this phones to enthusiasts and upgraders only.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

Perfect replacement for a long time android user,"Okay I NEED TO CLEAR a few misconceptions about this phone because i am seeing a lot of negative reviews here which are not true, probably from IOS haters. I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices  because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again.  FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is  real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in androidand lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here",64,RED,YES,3,Positive

One beast of a phone.,"I am writing this after a week of my usage with this iPhone 12. I have had the X before and OnePlus 6T as well.Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I’ll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don’t usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I’ll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don’t play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don’t believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box.",64,RED,YES,3.5,Positive

Moving from Android to iOS?,"Yes, it is a 5 star phone. But if you are moving from android to iPhone please be ready to lose your freedom. There is a lot available on internet to tell you about what you will lose out on. It is like speaking a new language altogether.Quick image editing, video editing, simple things like making collages, setting custom ringtones, quick editing of alarms, changing WiFi or Bluetooth, toggling location, many more basic features are either absent in iOS or managed in a very cumbersome way. You will miss them if moving from Andriod. Also be ready to lose your WhatsApp chat history. Not impressed by the sound reproduction on bigger speakers via Bluetooth and the very inflexible equilizer.For some silly reasons Apple is being stubborn on some aspects like standardisation of charging cable even within its own products. The notch at the top of the screen is still the same size it was in 2018.Rest, there are tons of reviews to praise the phone and I agree with most of them.Was a bit disappointed the way it was packaged.

Intelligence of future,"I was an avid android user for past 25 years. This move to IPhone 12 was a calculative yet bolder definitive move.Let’s look at the some of key pointers here what I saw -- Stunning design and spectacular OLed display pouring out all the vivid colors- Smooth app flow and transitions- Longer battery life 7-8 hrs without automation (best in my usage)-  Camera is just bringing the life out of all the captures you make.*I am using Apple 20w charger which is insane at charging 20-25 percent in 7 mins. So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty. It’s almost a month of usage and I can boldly say, “The best switch one can make”. I know the price tag is always hefty but then you are choosing a long term reliability. Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.*What I come to see is why Apple looked for environmental protection by removing charger and earphones. I guess it should come at a reasonable price then. It really put me off but then you know what the market player is serving.",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

I prefer the 11 or the 12 mini,"I have been an apple user for the past 10 years and this is the first phone which is disappointing. I was using the Xr and 11 before this and though of upgrading.1. If you are moving from an android to iPhone for the 1st time, its a great phone to get in terms of camera, processor, screen quality. But if you are already an existing iPhone user, upgrade only from XR downwards. That is if your are upgrading from a 8/X/XS/XR. If you have a 11, stick to it. Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones. Now for me this was one the reasons I didn\'t like the phone. It wasn\'t comfortable n the hand after being used to the curve of the X and 11 and XR3. Camera- best camera quality with night mode . u can\'t go wrong with this camera setup.4. screen- excellent screen quality , no complaints here.5. 5g - IS it really that big a deal breaker ? especially if you are in India where 5g seems a long way off.6. No charging adapter. You either have to connect it to your MacBook or buy a separate power adapter. When ur spending 70 odd grand, that\'s the least apple could offer.7. again no ear phones.8. It somehow doesn\'t have the wow factor as what the X had.Update.I exchange my phone for a 12 mini. much more easier to use with one hand and comfortable.",64,RED,YES,4.5,Positive

Worst replacement experience,"I ordered iPhone 12 64gb from amazon in the time of amazon great Indian sale. After I received the phone few min later start showing a permanent green line top to bottom in the middle of the display. I was trying for replacement and Amazon gave me Apple store India number and I said all issue about phone to apple store india. They told me We can\'t do anything you have to contact with Amazon and then I call to amazon after they discuss with their senior team . Amazon told me you have to visit apple store or apple authorised services centre for deny latter. I visited the apple authorised service centre (Imagine store) and scan a barcode , register and i got my token number . When my turn came i told them i need deny latter for amazon replacement. They start diagnosis my phone after some time they gave me deny latter. After that i call amazon i said i have deny latter now replace my phone and he said hold some time i connect you with our seniors but he fail to connect my call (Evening time). Next day i call again to amazon and show her deny latter and she said this latter don\'t have any apple logo we  can\'t do anything. That time i was like 🤬😡. Then I cut the call and call to the apple authorised service centre about logo , they said only official apple store put the  apple logo in the latter. Then I call amazon a lady she already knew my issue and replaced my phone. In the time of  replacement delivery refused to deliver phone my phone he said I didn\'t get any updates about replacement even in our office also. So you have to visit our office for further . After I visited and wait an hour then finally i got my replacement. 😐",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Great phone. Prices in India not so great,Battery life is good. Great display. Point and shoot is always good on iphones. Phone has all that you need.Prices is always high and we still buy like fools and to top it we dont get earphones nor the power brick.The last thing is we do not get quality military standard drop protective cases which is the worst thing its nothing related to phone but good to know info. Even if you get they are some of the worst ones and price is atleast three time more compared to the original product price.And if your buying Apple warranty you will keep draining your money as they have the worst support. They only believe in replacements and I am sure its not worth it to pay 18k for an year.,64,RED,YES,5,Positive

Due to low battery always be in mind but if you leave that top notch smartphone A14 bionic chip🙌,So till now what concerns me is only the battery and everything by far is top notch and I was a little hesitating before purchasing it since this was my first interaction with the iOS environment but now I am used to it and works fine. Since I am not a fan of too much customization so for me this UI is totally fine. Plus gaming experience was also good till now I played nfs no limit and it works like a champ. I also really like it\'s ram working since my app in background keeps running without always reloading it when again opened.One last since I haven\'t used 120 Hz refresh rate so I can’t tell about it but since my old phone was also no having it so for me it\'s awesome👌.Camera is also awesome till now I haven\'t used it much due to covid but in low light it worked too good no doubt about it:).Hope this will help someone😁,64,RED,YES,4,Positive

"Excellent phone, beautiful colour♥️","Excellent phone, only reason I have reduced one star is since Amazon reduced the price by Rs 3000 the day after I received the phone and this really hurts after spending so much of my hard earned money. Exchange value received for my older phone was also pretty inadequate, considering the condition it was in.Pros:1. The green colour is gorgeous2. Cameras are outstanding3. Battery life is really good, lasts me almost 2 days on a charge4. Screen is very bright and has vibrant colours5. Speaker is very loudCons:1. Just nitpicking, but a fingerprint sensor would have been much more convenient during Covid2. Indian variant doesn\'t have the mmWave antenna, inspite of being more expensive than the US VariantOverall, a great buy.TIP: Please do not buy 64 GB model, unless you have a robust cloud subscription to upload stuff into.",64,RED,YES,4.5,Positive

The BOSS Phone..!!! iPhone 12 truly a masterpiece from Apple.,"I am writing this review after using my iPhone 12 for three weeks and I must say the decision I took to switch from android(I have been an android user for the last 8years xD xD) to iOS has been incredible. The experience is commendable, iPhone 12 is the best phone in the market as of now.  I haven’t faced any battery issue or any heating issues as I have seen other reviews complaining the battery and heating of the iPhone. Attached are a few sample shots I took from my iPhone to show that the Apple’s camera quality is unmatched and surreal.  The Face unlock is great, the battery’s pretty good, camera’s excellent….overalls my whole transition from android to iOS has been great. Go for this phone guysss…. It’s the best in the segment with some mind blowing iOS features. P.S. Just got updated to iOS 14.6 😊😊😊",64,RED,YES,4,Positive
Awesome delivery as promised,Amazon delivered the product as promised and got the exact items that I have ordered. I am a android user for years and this shift to ios was not easy but believe me once you get a hang of the software it’s the best experience. It’s better to be simple and efficient. IOS experience is like using a cell phone like a cell phone. If your budget allow best phone in the market for sure .,64,RED,YES,4.5,Positive
Simply Wow!,"Been using this for a couple of days now and trust me if you have the budget then just go for it. Battery backup is amazing if you are not a heavy gamer, Fast charging is simply Wow if you uses 20w original apple charger. Rest I hope you all know that\'s why you are still searching for this product. So in short this is the best phone to grab this year!",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

Excellent!,"Superb phone! Amazing same day delivery!I have more to add to my earlier review after roughly a month of use. The phone is an original Apple device. It\'s smooth and quick, and it doesn\'t become hot when in use or charging. The charge lasts the entire day (I use it mostly for social media, web browsing and music) Face recognition is excellent. Battery health is 100% (check this when you receive your phone under ‘battery health\' in settings) and to keep it that way, make sure you close all background apps while the phone is not in use. Play a ‘pixel test 4K\' video on YouTube to see if your phone monitor has any dead pixels. I use the original Apple adaptor (which must be purchased separately) and the type C cable that comes in the box. Overall the phone is a great purchase!",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Overall good phone with some minor setbacks.,"Overall good phone as it feels very premium, being made with high quality materials and has great performance. Excellent camera quality, great design and screen quality. The A14 processor is super fast and the phone never heats up even while performing intensive tasks. The speakers are very loud and clear and give out high quality sound.One problem I encountered is that  the battery life is not great but definitely above average. Another issue is the notch which makes the phone look outdated especially in 2021. The Face ID is also not useful while wearing masks which causes a lot of inconvenience since the phone doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner. The phone is also limited to a 60Hz refresh rate which again makes it less compelling than the competition which makes phones with 120Hz refresh rate at a much lower price.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

Smart option compared to pro model,"Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn’t seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

I need to charge it once for full day usage(not an heavy user) while using internet. OLED display is superb. Being an Android user since start, I was not able to restore my Whatsapp data in IOS which was one of the drawbacks. Overall it is good phone but overpriced. You won\'t get charger and earphones. There is a challenge to try new apps as most of the apps in IOS are paid  with just 3-7 days trial period. There are other brands in market who provides similar features at very less cost but at the end it\'s IOS vs Android.",64,RED,YES,5,Positive

What a Phone. Its iPhone,"Its my First Apple device. Happy to own it after a long confusion between iPhone 11 and 12. I believe, it was worth waiting for 12.Received it on 04-Nov-2020. Working well till now. Checked Service Support Coverage. Its a genuine product.AndiPhone in white color is legend.Update after 1 month approx.-----------------------------------After using it for a month I am in love with this phone. Too smooth and I forgot what is lagging...Battery backup is very good and lasts one and half day easily with normal usage. I charge my phone when the battery is around 30%. Battery health is 100% after a month.Camera is awesome and gives very nicely detailed pictures with true colors.Phone speakers are really great and warm. They are loud but don\'t shout. Listening music or watching videos are enjoyable without earphones too.4G speed better than other 4g phones I have.Worth every penny.",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

perfect,everything is good about this phone. But the battery life is a bit less but it’s apple product so nobody cares about the battery life although it charges quickly only with the apple charger you buy separately and the battery life is enough for daily use but it drains quickly if you play high end games.,64,RED,YES,5,Positive

Just Amazed with the display and quality,"New Apple iphone 12 is too amazing. I have switched from android (Oneplus 6T) to iPhone.Below are my reviews after using for 3 days.Pros: Amazing look, feel, display, very smooth touch and face recognition is ‘the best’. Lot of new features in camera like studio light, night mode etc.Just 2 cons: Little small in size as compared to oneplus 6T and battery life is upto my expectation.If anyone really want to switch to iphone, this is a great deal(P.S. got 14% discount)#happycustomer",64,RED,YES,4,Positive

Great..,The performance is amazing. Potrait mode could have been better only If there was a telephoto camera instead of ultra wide. But I am ok with the ultra wide. Many complain the battery life is not good but for me I am able do last one whole day with single charge. Surely it depends upon person to person usage. Overall i am really happy with this mobile.,64,RED,YES,5,Positive

iPhone 12 review,"Honestly if you have a XR, you don’t need to go for this unless you are a core fan of video games. For a normal user, any Apple phone above 6 is still a good bet.
