The only things that I use my phone are for calling, whatsapp, taking notes, some light photography and watching videos. The most heavily used activity on my phone is watching videos on youtube.With all these activities being done, my weekly average screen on time is 2-3 hours. I am satisfied with the battery life. It has been around 3 months of usage and the battery capacity is still 100%.  With heavy usage, the phone lasts 6 hours give or take a few minutes, and with medium usage this goes way higher.The standby time is excellent on this device. I have had instances where I used my phone for a total of 2-3 hours but a single charge lasted more than 36 hours.All in all, I can confidently say that I am very happy with the security features the phone offers and I am happy with my purchase.',\n",
